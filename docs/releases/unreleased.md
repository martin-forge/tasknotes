```

-->

## Fixed

- Made the markdown editor areas in task modals easier to click and focus.
- Reduced false-positive plugin review warnings by making background auto-export and auto-archive schedulers non-overlapping and tightening type/string conversion paths.
- (#1823) Fixed zero-duration timed external calendar events rendering on multiple days in list-style calendar views
  - Adds a minimal display duration before passing point-in-time external events to FullCalendar
  - Preserves the original provider event data for context menus and debugging
- Google Calendar task descriptions now use mobile-friendly plain text for Obsidian links and display labels for wiki-style project/context links.
- Persist failed Google Calendar task-event deletions in plugin data and retry them after restart or reconnect, preventing orphaned task events when a task file is deleted while Google cleanup fails or sync is not ready.
- Track exported Google Calendar task events in plugin data so startup can recover cleanup for task files deleted while Obsidian was closed.
- Persist Google Calendar task sync requests while Google Calendar is not ready and replay the current task state after reconnect for scheduled, due, or both-date calendar modes.
- Restore cancelled Google Calendar event tombstones when a task is synced to an existing event ID, so deleted-but-still-addressable events become visible again.
- Prevent duplicate Google Calendar task events when concurrent syncs race before the newly created event ID reaches Obsidian metadata.
- Prevent pending intermediate status updates from overwriting completed Google Calendar task events when users quickly cycle a task to done.
- Mark Google Calendar events as completed when tasks were already done before they became calendar-eligible.
