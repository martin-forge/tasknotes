## Fixed

- (#1696) Fixed Google Calendar export for scheduled recurring tasks when a single occurrence is moved to a different date.
  - Keeps the recurring master event on its original rule, excludes the original occurrence date, and syncs the moved occurrence as a detached event.
- (#1921) Fixed Google Calendar and auto-archive side effects falling stale after direct task file edits.
  - Reconciles lifecycle-relevant frontmatter changes through the existing task file update event, with a first-run fingerprint baseline to avoid bulk startup API writes.
  - Periodic recovery also cleans up indexed Google Calendar events whose task files were deleted or replaced while TaskNotes was running.
- (#1911) Fixed recurrence choices starting from today instead of the selected calendar date when creating a task from Calendar view.
  - Thanks to @mikhailmarka for reporting.
